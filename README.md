## 🚀 Live Apps

### 1. 🛡️ YouTube Comment Spam Classifier  
Predicts whether a YouTube comment is spam or not using NLP.  
🔗 [Try the App](https://app-projects-codswfznsoai3mlknvqvsa.streamlit.app/)

### 2. 🏦 Loan Approval Predictor  
Predicts whether a loan will be approved based on financial and personal input details using Random Forest and XGBoost models.  
🔗 [Try the App](https://app-projects-bpgjh4riyznxdtbmjen3tc.streamlit.app/)

### 3. 🧠 Brain Tumor MRI Classifier  
A deep learning model (CNN) trained to classify brain MRI scans into four categories: **Glioma**, **Meningioma**, **Pituitary**, and **No Tumor**.  
🔗 [Try the App](https://app-projects-vbc93rqtnisk9z8whihewb.streamlit.app/)  


### 4. 🎭 IMDB Sentiment Analyzer  
A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) trained on the IMDB movie reviews dataset to classify sentiment as **Positive** or **Negative**.  
🔗 [Try the App](https://app-projects-zr8dr9ccrjqfdtfqm45w9k.streamlit.app/)  

### 5. 🎥 Smart Exam Proctoring System (No AI/ML)
